# Cover Letter Generator

## Overview
The **Cover Letter Generator** is a web application designed to generate personalized cover letters based on an uploaded resume and a job description link. The project utilizes **FastAPI** for the backend, **Hugging Face** and **LangChain** for natural language processing (LLM-based cover letter generation), and a simple **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** frontend.

## Features
- Upload your resume (PDF or text format)
- Provide a job description link
- Automatically generate a tailored cover letter using AI
- Download the generated cover letter for job applications

## Tech Stack
### Backend
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for Python
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For utilizing powerful language models (LLM)
- **LangChain**: Enhances LLMs to generate structured and meaningful cover letters
- **Render (Free Version)**: Used for deploying the backend server

### Frontend
- **HTML, CSS**: Provides the structure and styling for the web interface
- **JavaScript (script.js)**: Handles frontend logic and interacts with the backend API

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.8)
- Node.js (if needed for frontend development)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cover-letter-generator.git
   cd cover-letter-generator
   ```

   ```
4. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup
